# PenTestEnv

My custom automated installation script for Penetration Testing Tools on Ubuntu

> Inspired by [Luke Smith's LARBS](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS)

## Installation

Log into the user account you want to install the tools for.

Note that the user account should have `sudo` privilege.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SpiritWithoutWalls/PenTestEnv.git && cd PenTestEnv
$ chmod u+x pentestenv.sh && ./pentestenv.sh
```

## Customization

By default, `pentestenv.sh` will parse the programs in [pentestpkg.csv](https://github.com/SpiritWithoutWalls/PenTestEnv/blob/main/pentestpkg.csv) and install them all.

The first column is a "tag" that determines how the program is installed. The definition of the tags are listed as follows:

Tag | Install methods
--- | ---------------
(blank) | main repository (apt)
G | git repository (make && make install)
P | pip install
M | manually with specific instructions
X | ignore the program

> `curl` and `git` will be installed automatically as prerequisites

For the programs that could not be installed in main or git repository, use the `M` tag for manual installation in `pentestpkg.csv` and set up the installation steps in the section of  `ManualInstall` function in [pentestenv.sh](https://github.com/SpiritWithoutWalls/PenTestEnv/blob/main/pentestenv.sh).

The second column is the name of the program in the repository, or the link to the git repository, and the third column is a description that describes the program.
